# Hyper-parameter-optimization
I took an optimization course with my dear professor, Dr. Bijan Ahmadi (@kakavandi). For this course, I have to submit two or three projects, which I will share with you in this repository. The focus of these projects is on optimizing the hyperparameters of a neural network model with a powerful package called ray tune.

The professor to whom I have to hand over these projects is Dr. Taheri (@zahta), who accepted the effort and accompanied us and Dr. Ahmadi in this course.
