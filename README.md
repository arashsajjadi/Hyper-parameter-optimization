# Hyper-parameter-optimization
I took an optimization in Data Science course with my dear professor, Dr. Bijan Ahmadi. For this course, I have to submit two or three projects, which I will share with you in this repository. The focus of these projects is on optimizing the hyperparameters of a neural network model with a powerful package called ray tune.
