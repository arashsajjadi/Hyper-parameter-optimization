# Hyperparameter-optimization
I took an optimization course with my dear professor, Dr. Bijan Ahmadi ([@kakavandi](https://github.com/kakavandi)). For this course, I have to submit two or three projects, which I will share with you in this repository. The focus of these projects is on optimizing the hyperparameters of a neural network model with a powerful package called ray tune.

+ The professor to whom I have to hand over these projects is Dr. Taheri ([@zahta](https://github.com/zahta)), who accepted the effort and accompanied us and Dr. Ahmadi in this course.
+ During these projects I will cooperate with Mr. Mahmoud Hashempour ([@Mahmoud4812](https://github.com/Mahmoud4812)) .

*The data set that I am going to work on during this project is the molecular data set. Since my focus in this project is only on optimizing the hyper-parameters of a neural network, I will refrain from additional explanations about the nature of the data and introduce them briefly.*
