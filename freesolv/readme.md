# Freesolv

Freesolv is a regression-oriented dataset. My chosen Error during this project was *MSE loss*.I used the **featurewiz** package to select best and informative features. The neural network of this project is done with the help of **Pytorch** and the optimization of hyperparameters with the help of **ray tune** package.
